## Construction of Multiple Epitope Vaccine Against H3N8 Strain of Avian Influenza: A Bioinformatics Approach

### Background
-
-
-

### Objectives
-
-

### Methods
- The sequence of H3N8 spike glycoprotein was retrieved from uniprot database (https://www.uniprot.org) with accession number P16995.
- The physicochemical properties of the selected protein were checked by ExPASy-ProtParam tool (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/). The molecular weight, theoretical pI, amino acid and atomic composition, extinction coefficient, estimated half-life, instability index, aliphatic index, and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) are among the parameters that were computed.
- B-cell and T-cell epitopes were predicted using the bioinformatics tool Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) (http://tools.iedb.org/main/).
- The secondary structure of the protein was analyzed by PSIPRED online tool (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/).
- The antigenicity of the protein was checked using VaxiJen 2.0 (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxiJen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html).
- Allergenicity of the protein was checked using AllerTOP v2.0, which is an online server (https://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP/method.html).
- The population coverage of the shortlisted 10 epitopes was analyzed by using the IEDBâ€™s Population Coverage (http://tools.iedb.org/population/) with default parameters.
- ToxinPred tool was used for the prediction of toxicity (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/)
